This project improved the application onWatch - HackUCSC2016. Improved the functions, cleaned the code, added new functionality and designed a better graphic interface.

Improvements:
- Improved the graphic interface.
- The threat states can be updated from the device without needing a pebble watch.
- There is recording of sound once in PANIC MODE
- Once a person de-escalates their threat state, then it notifies the emergency contacts of that change
